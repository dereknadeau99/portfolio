				<p class="text" id="about_me">

					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;"> Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently a rising senior at the University of Pittsburgh, where I am pursuing a degree in computer science and a minor in music. My career interests post-graduation include working in the self-driving car industry, the field of machine learning, music production, and many more. 

					<br><br>

					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;"> I'm originally from Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and grew up right next to a minor league baseball stadium. I'm an Eagle Scout, an honor I received back in the summer of 2017, following my Eagle Service Project, where I fundraised for the purchase of two AEDs for two churches in my hometown that were lacking them, as well as organizing a CPR training session for the attendees of these churches.

					<br><br>

					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;"> I interned with a company named Compunetix in 2019, where I helped develop a new and exciting business conferencing software. During my internship there, I gained a great deal of experience with respect to full-stack development, large-scale project management, and resourcefulness in a technological setting. 

					<br><br>

					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;"> It can be tough to find time for fun projects during the busy school year, but I try my best to do so whenever I have the oppurtunity. Pictured to the left is me and a few of my friends at SteelHacks 2020, Pitt's biggest annual hackathon. Together, over the course of 24 hours, we wrote software and built a rig to try and get an Etch-a-Sketch to automatically draw any picture that we uploaded to our program. While just 24 hours proved too short of a time to finish fully, we were succesful in automatically drawing simple uploaded geometric shapes, and we learned a whole lot about the project design process on the way.
